### Data collection brief
The [folding phoropter](http://lvpmitra.com/phoropter) is an [award-winning device](http://mashable.com/2016/11/02/social-good-innovations-october-2016/#iK896J3Dc5qu) built at the Srujana Center for Innovation, [L V Prasad Eye Institute](http://www.lvpei.org) (LVPEI), Hyderabad, India, to combat the disproportionate access to tools for screening for refractive error in low resource areas. This device is extremely low-cost, disposable, easy to assemble and open-source, which means anyone can build their own following the instructions. Read more [here](http://lvpmitra.com/phoropter). A short video explaining the device is here:

Data was collected at the Kallam Anji Reddy Campus of LVPEI during June 2016 on 125 refractive error patients and volunteers (250 eyes). The criteria for inclusion in the study was:
* Adults (over 18 years of age)
* No ocular diseases besides refractive error and astigmatistm
* All would be current or past patients of LVPEI, whose data would be on file
